## Data Acquisition 

###Â Challanges 
- Dynamic ID's
Job search bar id is 'jobs-search-box-keyword-id-ember' followed by a 2-digit number.
This number is random

This only occurred when accessed through certian URL's, which I have avoided

- Dynamic loading 
'about this job', appears to load dynamically 
To solve, had to enforce sleeps and button interactions to get the data
